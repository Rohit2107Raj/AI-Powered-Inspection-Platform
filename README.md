🛠️ AI-Powered Industrial Diagnostics Platform
This project is an AI-based diagnostic platform designed for smart manufacturing and predictive maintenance. It integrates three key modules:

🔍 Surface Defect Detection
Uses a ResNet-50 CNN model to classify surface defects from industrial images (NEU dataset), enabling quality inspection automation.

📉 Fault Detection in Machinery
Analyzes sound and vibration data using feature extraction techniques like FFT and Librosa, and applies machine learning models (SVM, Random Forest) to detect mechanical faults such as imbalance, misalignment, and bearing damage.

⏳ Predictive Maintenance
Implements time-series analysis to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of components based on sensor data, helping reduce downtime and improve maintenance scheduling.

🌐 Web App Deployment
All three modules are integrated into a Streamlit-based web application for real-time diagnostics, interactive visualizations, and industrial use-case simulation.
